Hiya,

I forwarded some patches upstream so here's the list of stuff I did:

- Opened [PR #60](https://github.com/arnau/ISO8601/pull/60) for ISO8601 to
  fix RuboCop offenses (as the maintainer needed some help!)
- Opened [PR #175](https://github.com/mvz/gir_ffi/pull/175) for gir_ffi to
  drop `git ls-files` in gemspec.
- Reviewed [PR #22](https://github.com/ahoward/session/pull/22) for session
  which fixes some tests (also helps the Debian side).
- Did frontdesk duty for LTS.

Later that day, I did Ruby and Rails 101. Some JH course on Coursera.

`:wq` for today.
