Hallo,

Today I did a lot of searching and experimenting with different things
that could potentially fix the usage of `git ls-files`.

Whilst there are a lot of possible alternatives for using pure Ruby,
the problem is that they don't "respect" the `.gitignore` file.  

So whilst exploring, I stumbled upon using `rake/file_list`.  
Something like this:
```ruby
require 'rake/file_list'
spec.files = Rake::FileList['**/*'].exclude(*File.read('.gitignore').split)
```

To my surprise, it handles patterns quite well:
```ruby
FileList['a.c', 'b.c'].exclude(/^a/)  => ['b.c']
FileList['a.c', 'b.c'].exclude("a.*") => ['b.c']
```

However, it doesn't quite support **all** the rules, like using `!`, et al.

Thanks to David, I stumbled upon a very nice gem, [fast_ignore](https://github.com/robotdana/fast_ignore).  
This seems to be a eureka moment, I believe!? :o

Whilst I did some experiments with this, too, I am yet to look more on this.  
I hope tomorrow :)

`:wq` for today.
