Hello,

So something interesting happened today! I received a pull request for
batalert, fixing README (and making it better!). Here:
[https://github.com/utkarsh2102/batalert/pull/3](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/batalert/pull/3).

And then I did some pending AI lab assignment.  
And finally uploaded sup-mail to Sid, on Iain's request!

`:wq` for today.
