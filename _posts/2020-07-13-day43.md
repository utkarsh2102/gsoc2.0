Hello,

Whilst Sundays are for ELTS, I didn't quite follow the norm.  
Instead, I worked on little bits of different things.

So today I did some ELTS stuff!

- Issued [ELA 240-1](https://deb.freexian.com/extended-lts/updates/ela-240-1-wpa), fixing [CVE-2020-12695](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12695), for [wpa](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/wpa).

- Issued [ELA 241-1](https://deb.freexian.com/extended-lts/updates/ela-241-1-openjpeg2), fixing [CVE-2020-15389](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-15389), for [openjpeg2](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/openjpeg2).  

- Added a note about my frontdesk duty from 28th June to 05th July.

- Also, added all the triaged packages in the draft blog.


And then I sponsored the upload for ruby-growl for Cocoa.

And finally, I explored the new feature released by GitHub about having
personalized READMEs. So I plan to set up one @utkarsh2102/utkarsh2102
soon enough! :)

`:wq` for today.
