Hi,

So today was a bit..crazy! We had a 14-hour power outage, no electricity,
no internet, no charging, nothing! :x

Anyway, so we had a quick audio call today. So no snapshot (again!) :/

After the call, I focused a bit on writing packaging-style-guide, the very
(verbose) documentation of RuboCop::Packaging.

Besides, earlier today, I also completed all my pending logs! So yay! \o/

`:wq` for today.
