Hiya,

So finally today I spent 75% of my day, working on completing the pending
logs -> around 15-20ish were pending :x

So happy to finally say that I am back on track, at least, for now!

Besides that, I finally got around to fixing the `cops_documentation` Rake
task, which uses `CopsDocumentationGenerator` class from [PR 8369](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/pull/8369)
by Benjamin.  
That Rake task finally works now (it was broken by the new auto-correct
API thingy), and I've opened [PR #7](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/pull/7)
for the same.

For now, I've labelled it as "don't merge" because the new class will only
be available in the next release of RuboCop.

`:wq` for today.
