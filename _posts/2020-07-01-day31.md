Hi,

I put a lot of effort in my monthly blogs so I spent almost all the day for
that. Well, not all.

I did some LTS work too, because Stretch is the new LTS from now on! \o/  
So I did the pending Jessie stuff:
- Issued [DLA 2269-1](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/07/msg00000.html)
  for wordpress for a bunch of CVE(s).
- Issued [DLA 2270-1](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/07/msg00001.html)
  for jackson-databind for a bunch of CVE(s).
- Issued [DLA 2271-1](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/07/msg00002.html)
  for coturn for CVE-2020-4067.

Then compiled and pushed blog.

(it also has GSoC phase 1, part 2 stuff!)

`:wq` for today.
