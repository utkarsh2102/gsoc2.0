Hola,

Thanks to Antonio for reviewing the code for `Packaging/GemspecGit`
and raising [PR#1](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/pull/1) :)

Today, I hacked on fixing RuboCop offenses and warnings -- afterall, it's
not really good that there are RuboCop offenses in a RuboCop extension,
no? :P

I committed the following changes:

- [@3264d3b](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/commit/3264d3be01c8e5643a2932dab800f0fdcd915c74):
  Add development dependencies & moving gems from `Gemfile` to
  `gemspec` -- I like things to be at one place :)

- [@119cb04](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/commit/119cb04896ef024408528d62607ccdb03c3067ef):
  Fix RuboCop offenses and warnings ðŸ˜Œ

- [@6bb4e2c](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/commit/6bb4e2c11a85447373eb392d4836ee2d2fabd4c3):
   Run RuboCop as the default task and fix `config/default.yml`.

- [@4451e41](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/commit/4451e412b1c9946012817ae8ff0c8618b9d4aec0):
  Configure CI to add Ruby 2.4.10 as well and don't run
  `generate_cops_documentation` task for now.

And finally, CI is green and happy again! :D  
Now all that left is the documentation part and then comes the time for
the inital release! \o/

Later tonight, I attended a video meet for
[Debian @ COVID-19 Biohackathon](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2020/06/msg00091.html).

`:wq` for today.
