Hiya,

In bullets, here's the stuff I worked on:

- Opened [PR #721](https://github.com/cucumber/aruba/pull/721) for `aruba`
  to drop `git` in gemspec & use `rubocop-packaging`. Got merged!

- Opened [PR #25](https://github.com/RubyCrypto/ed25519/pull/25) for
  `ed25519` to drop `git` in gemspec & use `rubocop-packaging`. Got merged!

- Opened [MR #4413](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/merge_requests/4413)
  for `omnibus-gitlab` to fix RuboCop warning and stuff.

- Sponsored:
  - ruby-growl for Cocoa.
  - ruby-xmpp4r for Cocoa.
  - ruby-uniform-notifier for Cocoa.

And then, we had our weekly meeting!  
Here's the snapshot, as usual:

Unfortunately, David couldn't join. So me and Antonio discussed the status
of the 2nd cop. He helped me understand about `stubs` and `mocks` and we
finally got the tests working! \o/

`:wq` for today.
