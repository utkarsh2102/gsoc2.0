Hey,

After completing the Ruby part of the course, I had to do a programming
assignment which was graded.

The assignment was to find the maximum word frequency across each line
of the file.  
Here's my take: [https://github.com/utkarsh2102/max_word_frequency](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/max_word_frequency)

Well, I just did some part of it. Just like 45% so far.

And then later, I refactored some parts of that code^  
(not sure why exactly! :P)

And finally, I started to work on `get_root`, a helper module which will
help me to get the root of the project repository, which is what we need
in rubocop-packaging now!

`:wq` for today.
