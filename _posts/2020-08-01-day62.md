Hey,

When 01st day of the month lies on a weeked (and particularly Saturday),
it's a game-changer..

I essentially write blogs on 1st and 15th of every month and on weekends,
I do all of my (E)LTS work. Imaging both two coming in together..

So well, I did the following things:

- Published bi-monthly blog: [https://utkarsh2102.com/posts/foss-in-july-20/](https://utkarsh2102.com/posts/foss-in-july-20/)
- Opened [PR #170](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer-rails/pull/170) for
  autoprefixer-rails to drop `git ls-files` in gemspec. Uses rubocop-packaging now.
- Worked on a bunch of (E)LTS things. Verbose update tomorrow.
- Refactored my bash scripts to Ruby for a better and cleaner output w/o
  any false-positives.

Whilst this might not sound a lot, it took me 16 hours of work today to get
everything done. Checkout everything at GitHub: [https://github.com/utkarsh2102/](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/)

`:wq` for today.
