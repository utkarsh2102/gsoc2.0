Hiya,

As the title suggest, I did the following things:

- Marked CVE-2020-3481/clamav as not-affected for Jessie.
- Added triaged entries for (E)LTS - pillow, gupnp, clamav.
- Completed AI lab assignment - had to write A* algorithm.
- Converted .ipynb to different formats.
- Wrote some TeX. Submitted the final PDF.
- Did some content team work for DC20.
- Did a little bit of more documentation. Got bored, so left mid-way :P
- And then finally, slept.

`:wq` for today.
