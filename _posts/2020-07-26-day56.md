Hiya,

So I spent all of my day learning and completing the Rails course and
learning new and exciting stuff, really loved it!

I learned:
- Black-box testing.
- Deploying on Heroku.
- Using some API to build my first Rails web-application.

It was indeed fun!  
I also did some other reviews and stuff and other DebConf thingy.

`:wq` for today.
