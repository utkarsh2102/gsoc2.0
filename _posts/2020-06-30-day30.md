Hiya,

Today was essentially the blog day. So I worked on a little bit on it for
tomorrow's blog, but...  
(ended up working on:)

- Raised [PR #1751](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/pull/1751) for `micro` to
  patch out unnecessary `Ftoa` and `FtoaWithDigits` function.
- Raised [PR #3765](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3765/commits) for
  `rubygems` to fix remaining RuboCop issues.  
  As usual, even though it was supposed to be a simple fix, it turned out to be
  huge, involving more fixes and writing tests...but was fun :)  
  - Fixed some remaining RuboCop issues.
  - Fixed Rakefile to make Style/SymbolArray happy.
  - Added blank lines to make Bundler/OrderedGems happy.
  - Fixed line spacing to make Layout/EmptyLines happy.
  - Added tests with different flag combinations.
  - Tagged the specs with :readline.

  And finally the CI was green and the PR was merged! \o/

`:wq` for today.
