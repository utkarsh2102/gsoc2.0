Hiya,

Today I spent most of my day on documenting the 2nd cop entirely and finish
up the pending stuff for v0.2.0 release! :D

Pushed that commit and made the PR ready to be reviewed! \o/

And also, I worked on lab of CSE414: Advanced Computer Networks where the
first lab assignment was to create a `msg{send,rcv}.c` program showing
Inter Process Communication (IPC).

And I also worked on (E)LTS a bit.

`:wq` for today.
