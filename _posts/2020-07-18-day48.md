Hey,

Well, for the starters, Marc Andre is really nice!  
He so generously took the time and reviewed my PR where the specs are
failing. He not only just reviewed them, but when I asked him if he knows
any reason as to why they're failing when they shouldn't have been, he
worked on writing a patch himself!!!!

Well, that's pretty big for me! This, I'll never forget!

So he fixed the tests himself and I'm very happy, of course :P

Anyway, so since that is done, I came back to finish by pending assignment
and even more LaTeX writing! Very fun! \o/

And later, I uploaded ruby-iso8601's new version to unstable.

`:wq` for today.
