नमस्ते,

Today was the meeting day -- the very first weekly sync call!  
Here's the snapshot \o/

![meeting snapshot](/assets/images/meeting1.png)

We discussed the following things:
- work done so far;
- the possibility of a solution for dropping `git` in the gemspec file;
- my target for next week -- which is to focus on rubocop.

After and before the meeting, I did some Debian stuff today.  
Mostly involving:
- preparing a fix for CVE-2005-1513, CVE-2005-1514, CVE-2005-1515,
  CVE-2020-3811, and CVE-2020-3812 for netqmail for jessie-security.
- preparing a fix for CVE-2019-8842 and CVE-2020-3898 for cups
  for jessie-security.
- preparing a fix for CVE-2020-8162, CVE-2020-8164, CVE-2020-8165,
  CVE-2020-8166, and CVE-2020-8167 for rails for Sid.
- preparing a fix for CVE-2020-11082 for ruby-kaminari for Sid.


Given the meeting got over at around 8 PM, I intend to start working
on Rubocop tomorrow onwards :)

`:wq` for today.
