Hello,

Well, well, say hello to `v0.2.0` of `rubocop-packaging`! ;)  
That's right, I made the release of the second cop finally today, much
awaited!! :D

Then it was a bit lengthy task to update this on the Debian side. But it
had to be done...so, I did the following things:

- Sponsored the upload of rubocop v0.88.0 for Antonio xD
- Uploaded ruby-rubocop-ast v0.1.0-2.
- Uploaded ruby-rubocop-rspec v1.42.0.
- Uploaded ruby-rubocop-packaging v0.2.0.

And also, sponsored the upload of sup-mail v1.0-3 for Iain.

`:wq` for today.
