Zdravo,

After getting the PR reviewed, I fixed that with the suggestions put forth.  
And also, I opened 2 PRs, 1 for `pry`, fixing their tests and 1 for
`bundler`, fixing some RuboCop offenses.

Here are the relevant links:

- [@a80a05e](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/commit/a80a05eed96f126e362b8848f4f3355d0741b7ce):
  Fix typo, co-authored by David.

- [@46726c8](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/commit/46726c84ff83d8f9f0bab5b93cc412ccf883c4d8):
  Slightly enhance documentation w.r.t suggestions given.

- Raised [PR #2140](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/2140), fixing one of
  their failing test in `pry`.

- Raised [PR #3731](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3731), fixing
  some RuboCop offenses by shipping a default `.rubocop.yml`.

`:wq` for today.
