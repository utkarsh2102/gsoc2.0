OlÃ¡,

Today I did final rounds of testing of `fast_ignore` and saw how could it
be implemented for further use.

First things first, the `fast_ignore` gem was itself using `git` :P
This had to be fixed. So I raised a PR: [robotdana/fast_ignore#9](https://github.com/robotdana/fast_ignore/pull/9) \o/

Furthermore, whilst doing some further testing on different methods,
like `ignore_files`, `ignore_rules`, et al, I discovered something
unsual:

```ruby
irb(main):001:0> require 'fast_ignore'
=> true
irb(main):002:0> FastIgnore.new(include_files: 'README.md', relative: true).to_a
=> ["bin/console", "bin/time", "bin/ls_seconds", "bin/ls"]
```

This has been reported as [robotdana/fast_ignore](https://github.com/robotdana/fast_ignore/issues/8).  
I hope this is a bug and not a feature :P


Next,  
I wondered what happens if I implement it in any of the gems.  
So I committed this in [batalert@6cc677d1](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/batalert/commit/6cc677d1b6cb246fbfdeb674551b14bba502b33b).

Turns out, as David explains and I quote,
> I wouldn't expect it to work because bundler needs to evaluate the
gemspec _before_ it is able to setup the `$LOAD_PATH` and everything else
so that you can require your dependency.

Hm, today I learned! I'll fairly admit that I didn't know this until today.  
So it's clear that we can't use `fast_ignore` **yet** BUT we know of
a workaround so far :)  
(looks like the next step should be to convince the bundler maintainers? :P)


Anyway, I think I am done exploring the alternatives for now. I'll shift
my focus on writing an extension now.  
I can worry about the alternatives thingy later.

`:wq` for today.
