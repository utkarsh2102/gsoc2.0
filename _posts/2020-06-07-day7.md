Salve,

Whilst I thought I'll take a day off today, I didn't.  
I ended up working even more instead :|

After reading my book for a while, I focused on learning more of basic
stuff in Ruby, like more about classes, my certain things behave
differently, and so on..

In the afternoon, I had a call with Dana. It went **amazing**!  
We did a pairing session and wrote some code -- I learned a great
deal of things from her, which I could've never learned, I think.  
Perhaps that's why you should pair program sometimes :)

Things that I learned (this is a note to self):  
(I don't expect other people to get this part of the log)
- RTFM :)
- Sometimes it's nicer to write tests side-by-side.
- Use `binding.pry` more often.
- Experimenting is often the way to go.

Another note to self: pair-program more.

Later today, I did some experimentation with Rubocop and stumbled upon
this cops issue: [rubocop#8091](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/issues/8091).

I wish this all gets over really soon. World has become a crazy place.

Anyway, later in the night, with my [FTP trainee](https://ftp-master.debian.org/)
hat on, I did some reviewing of the [NEW queue](https://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html).  

And finally uploaded `cups` to `jessie-security` -- thanks to Antonio \o/  
However interestingly, this fix (adding `127.0.1.1    $hostname`) needs
to be done by a **lottt** of people.  
It, indeed, is a problem with the way chroots are created.

`:wq` for today.
