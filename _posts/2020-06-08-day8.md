Hiya,

I didn't do a lot of stuff today towards the project side but did
considerable amount of learning about Ruby classes and objects.

Whilst one might argue that there's not a lot to do about it, I,
nonetheless, like to spend more time getting my basics right.

I learned more about `self` and why is it useful and other things.  
Honestly, I could never figure out the "real" use of it; mostly because,
I've never encountered such a situation to use it. I hope I do someday.  
Anyway, I did also learn about `itself v/s self` (as it came up in
suggestions :P)

And lastly, I did over some Ruby (style) guides to see what's what.

`:wq` for today.
