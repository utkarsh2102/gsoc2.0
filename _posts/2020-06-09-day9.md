Aloha,

I have finally got around to experimenting with rubocop-extension-generator
and have been playing more with it.  
I created a test repository that could be found [here](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging-test).

I have been experimenting with `ast` and how can I parse the `gemspec`
to get the available methods for `Gem::Specification`.

Turned out I can get a lot of help from [RuboCop::Cop::Gemspec](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/tree/master/lib/rubocop/cop/gemspec).

To begin with, perhaps something like this:
```
def_node_search :gem_specification, <<~PATTERN
  (block
    (send
      (const
        (const {cbase nil?} :Gem) :Specification) :new)
    (args
      (arg $_)) ...)
PATTERN
```

Thanks to David's advice,  
I hit another jackpot from where I can "steal" a lot of stuff (:P) from:
[RuboCop::Cop::Gemspec::DuplicatedAssignment](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/blob/master/lib/rubocop/cop/gemspec/duplicated_assignment.rb) \o/  
(I couldn't be happier :P)

P.S. I hope I can have something ready for the call this Thursday.

`:wq` for today.
