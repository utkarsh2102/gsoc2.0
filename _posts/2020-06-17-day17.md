Hello,

Today I released rubocop-package!!! \o/  
One of the happy moments^ :)

Other than that, here's what I did today:

- [@4b553b4](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/commit/4b553b47ecc997266bbaf10dc46f11abfb550048):
  Merged PR #2, documenting the entire stuff.

- [@8a15bc5](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/commit/8a15bc53377d2b8f8b274a7b23aefa32ba5d9a32):
  Added `config/default.yml` to `spec.files` and wrote its tests.

- [@db044b6](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging-test/commit/db0b4b69ef690f7dc7d3dde579a55258f9554332):
  For my university exam presentation, I wrote a quick but largely-incomplete
  implementation of `RelativeRequireToLib` cop.

- [@b368d09](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging-test/commit/b368d09c04436c0f4fecc65e60dced709a8bbb60):
  For the same presentation, I wrote another quick but largely-incomplete
  implementation of `RequireRelativeToLib` cop.

`:wq` for today.
