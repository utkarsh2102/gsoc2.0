Heya,

Coming back towards the very project this little journal is intended to
describe, rubocop-packaging.  
So meanwhile, I exported get_root as a helper function, David solved all
the problem altogether at once via rubocop’s [PR #8314](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/pull/8314).  
This introduced a new (public) method `#project_root` which superseeded
`get_root` and one could now get the root directory via
`RuboCop::ConfigLoader.project_root`. Ain’t he amazing!? \o/

This also means, I reverted those changes altogether and tweaked my WIP
PR to inculcate these changes via commit [@b06a8f86](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/pull/4/commits/b06a8f86836db03dd9d3f56dffab7daa6d09f7b9).  
However, the specs fail. But that doesn’t mean that the changes aren’t
correct :P  

Anyway, I left it for now for David's and Antonio's opinion and started
working on my blog post for tomorrow.

And also, opened issues for aruba and cucumber-rails to drop `git` in gemspec.

I also started using nheko, a nice, light-weight client for IRC/Matrix.  
And stumbled upon an issue, opened as [#238](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/238).

And finally,
- I uploaded ruby-pg and rubocop-packaging to unstable.  
- Sponsored the upload of ruby-xmpp4r for Cocoa.
- Did some fixes for rubygems package.

`:wq` for today.
