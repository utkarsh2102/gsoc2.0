Privet,

I have been experimenting more and more these days. And it's fun!  
(except for days where things don't make sense and doesn't work :/)

Here's, for instance, what 1 of my firefox instance looks like these days:

Anyway, as I said, I have been "experimenting" with stuff that I find in
docs, thinking that it should work, here's a visual representation of it:
![visual representation of stuff not working](/assets/images/experiments.png)

I like green stuff there^  
It tells me that I am getting closer to something (even if I am not :P).

I'll probably not write more, I'd rather finish up my
pending stuff.
