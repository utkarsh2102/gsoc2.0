Hello,

I got my [PR #175](https://github.com/mvz/gir_ffi/pull/175) merged today!  
That means, `gir_ffi` is also using `rubocop-packaging` ;)

And then later today, I did the 2nd half of the course, the main part,
RAILS!! :D

It's fun and scary and interesting, so hopefully I'll be able to complete
this on time! \o/

`:wq` for today.
