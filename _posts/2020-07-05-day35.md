Hey,

I did the following stuff today:

- Opened [PR #61](https://github.com/arnau/ISO8601/pull/61) for ISO8601
  doing some minor refactoring, making things ready for v0.13.0 release!
- Opened [PR #3791](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3791) for
  rubygems/bundler to remove redundant `bundler/setup` require from
  `spec_helper.rb` generated by `bundle gem`.
- Reviewed [PR #22](https://github.com/ahoward/session/pull/22) for session
  which fixes some tests (also helps the Debian side).

Later that day, I did some more Ruby and Rails from the course again.

`:wq` for today.
