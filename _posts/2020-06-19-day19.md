Hey,

I started my day with opening [PR #3749](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3740)
for Bundler, fixing the remaining RuboCop offenses.  

These offenses appear when you create a gem with `bundle gem foo` and run `rubocop`
over it.  
Initially, there were around 45 offenses detected, but with [#3731](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3731)
and this, the number of offenses have been reduced to 0.

Intially, I was hoping for it to be a no-brainer and a quick thing to get started with,
it turned out pretty much the opposite. I spent all my day hacking on the PR and
implementing the suggestions, as they were getting raised.

Most of my time went on this [WIP commit](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3740/commits/35a51040aae332afabd051eaa5b14f25e0079f61),
which adds a test to run `rubocop` on the generated (skeleton) gem.

Day ended with no luck on getting this done so we left it for others
to chip in more opinions.

And finally, I sponsored ~6 uploads, 4 for William and 2 more Nilesh.

`:wq` for today.
