Hello,

After so many twists and turn, I finaly got the CI greeeeeennn!  
Many thanks to David!  
[PR #3740](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3740) is now MERGED!!

As a brownie point, I raised [PR #3748](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3748)
which adds actions to automatically bump man page month.  
This was raised by David, himself, which was a boring, manual task.  
And he tells me that he loved it! So it makes my day! <3

I also reviewed a PR to add some suggestions.

And on the debci side, I got that MR merged as well!  
Thanks to Antonio for quick reviews and merging that! <3

`:wq` for today.
