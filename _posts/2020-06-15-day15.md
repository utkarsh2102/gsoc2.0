Marhabaan,

So today was the bi-weekly-th day (they should make this an official word),
and so today was the blog day.  
For those, who are not aware yet, I write bi-weekly blogs.

So I wrote the blog today, fixed some CSS (I like that hack), and wrote
some documentation for the library.

Here are the relevant commits:

- [@c8357eb](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/utkarsh2102.com/commit/c8357ebcc79b487129bbc6fdecac99f1f1b2f375):
  GSoC Phase 1 blog! \o/

- [@827eb73](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/utkarsh2102.com/commit/827eb73d5596e4fbb04fb5aba2bd2478ec5f75a5):
  The ultimate CSS hack to fix my blog for once and all! \o/

- [@d67f3bd](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/commit/d67f3bd522eadd7070dc61d52802338133745e75):
  Document `README.md` for the library.

- [@4bed899](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/commit/4bed8998b6ce03d01f3cc700881293942a784e6d):
  Generate `docs/` with the help of the rake task.

- And finally, raised [PR #2](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/pull/2)
  for updating the documentation for Antonio's and David's review.

`:wq` for today.
