Hey,

Of course, you'd know, weekends are for (E)LTS stuff!  
So I did the following things:

- Issued [DLA 2288-1](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/07/msg00020.html)
  for qemu for fixing 12 CVEs! \o/

- Issued [ELA 249-1](https://deb.freexian.com/extended-lts/updates/ela-249-1-qemu/)
  for qemu for fixing CVE-2020-{13659, 15863}.

Well, it was a hectic day. QEMU took quite a while, duh.

And then later today, I did my pending Rails course. Tiring but fun!

`:wq` for today.
