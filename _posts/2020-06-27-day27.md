Hey,

So while helping Abraham, we discovered the `git` call problem in
`rspec-pending_for`.  
So I raised a [PR #70](https://github.com/pboling/rspec-pending_for/pull/70)
for fixing the same and making that project use `rubocop-packaging` :D

And then did some study on Distribute Systems. Little, not much.

Also, raised some issues in other projects.

`:wq` for today.
