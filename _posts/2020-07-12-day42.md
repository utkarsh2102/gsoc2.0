Hiya,

So...I'm not sure what you get from the title, but the title says exactly
what I did today. Little bit of this, little bit of that!

I did a little bit of Debian stuff:
- Sponsored the upload of twig for William.
- Uploaded djangorestframwork-api-key to fix [#956920](https://bugs.debian.org/956920).

And then I took care of some MRs for GitLab.  
Also, bumped devise's and websocket-extensions' version, fixing some CVEs.

And finally later, I did some reading and other things.

`:wq` for today.
