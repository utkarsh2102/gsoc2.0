Annyeonghaseyo,

Given that the first cop is ready, the documentation part is left.  
And as someone has rightly said,
> Documentation is a love letter that you write to your future self.

So, I spent time on documenting stuff.  
Yeah, I said I won't work much, but meh, I am not sure how would the
implementation of the second cop will go :/

Anyway, here's the stuff that I did:

- [@dc4fbac](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/commit/dc4fbacdc01cf78c5a7ab2b00487d55638411993):
  Document GemspecGit cop.

- [@426be3b](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/commit/426be3badd36de1e43ecd1ad711ce8fbf561c4b1):
  Enable `generate_cops_documentation` task.

---

`:wq` for today.
