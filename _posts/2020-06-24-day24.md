Hey,

More hacks on rubocop-packaging:
I added `require_relative` calls and some tests via [@f3dc3d1](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/pull/4/commits/f3dc3d137916e31ed9c6ec8f2c120087d151416b).

And side-by-side, proposed another diff for replacing regex via comments
on the same PR, being reviewed by David and Antonio. But I understood that
what I did was super stupid :P

Probably we can come to some better conclusion and patch during the meeting
tomorrow \o/

Besides this, I raised [PR #3754](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3754),
for bundler, constraining the shipped RuboCop's version.

And lastly, I raised [PR #5](https://github.com/pboling/rspec-stubbed_env/pull/5),
fixing the "git" problem in rspec-stubbed_env, because Abraham Raji, while
packaging this for Debian, couldn't build this package in Debian.

I look forward to the meeting tomorrow! \o/

`:wq` for today.
