Hello,

So finally concluded the assignment and submitted for assessment.  
I got 100/100 because fortunately, all tests passed! \o/

It wasn't hard. What's hard is the next part...Rails!

Anyway, so I gemified that assignment and pushed the changes so that it
pretty now :)

And then I raised [PR #2307](https://github.com/puma/puma/pull/2307) for
puma to constrain `rake-compiler`'s version to v0.9.4.

And while working on RuboCop fixes (including rubocop-packaging), I hit a
false-positive auto-correct for `Style/WhileUntilModifier` and the "Infinite
loop detected" error. Raised as [issue #8273](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/issues/8273).

Did some NEW review and read some blogs, et al.

`:wq` for today.
