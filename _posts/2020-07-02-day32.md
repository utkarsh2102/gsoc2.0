Hello,

So, we didn't have a meeting today because my university decided to host
a session on how they want to ahead and conduct the next semester and exams
thanks to the COVID-19 fiasco.

However, did the following things:
- Added DLA entries for wordpress, jackson-databind, and coturn.
- Fix image alignments and typos in blog.
- Fix lts-dla script to include /pkg/ in the package link.
- Merged PR #6, fixing the blank file issue in rubocop-packaging.
- Did some frontdesk duty for LTS.

And hooray, Bundler v2.2.0.rc.1 is out!  
Thanks to David for all the work he did! \o/

`:wq` for today.
