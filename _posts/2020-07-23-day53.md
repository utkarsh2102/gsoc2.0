Hiya,

So we had our meeting day today! \o/  
The bad thing is I lost the today's snapshot unfortunately so... :c

But the good thing is that I've got green signal from Antonio to merge the
PR and cut v0.2.0 release. And not wait for Marc Andre's comments.

So yay! I merged that PR! \o/

And the other good news is that I finally completed my lab assignment and
wrote more LaTeX to convert the `.ipynb` into a beautiful PDF file.

So yay, yay!

`:wq` for today.
