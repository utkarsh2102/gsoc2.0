Hey,

So I was completing my todo, which had "Refactoring autoprefixer-rails and
drop `git ls-files` from gemspec" in it.

Thus I got onto it.

I opened 3 PRs:

- [PR #166](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer-rails/pull/166) for using
  RuboCop.
- [PR #167](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer-rails/pull/167) for fixing
  remaining RuboCop issues.
- [PR #169](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer-rails/pull/169) to fix
  remaining issues with minor refactoring.

And then whilst working on it, I noticed a problem with rubocop-packaging
that the 2nd cop was producing false-positives and it is not really good.  
So opened [issue #8](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/issues/8)
for the same.

Besides, also opened [issue #8418](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/issues/8418)
for reporting the broken auto-correct for `Style/FrozenStringLiteralComment`
Cop, but turns out the new auto-correct API uses `-A` now and not `-a`. D'oh.

`:wq` for today.
