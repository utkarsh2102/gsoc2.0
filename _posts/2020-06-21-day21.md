Hiya,

Instead of hoping to learn more about Distributed Systems, I spent most of
my time on fixing the PR to ship an offense-less skeleton gem, created by
bundler.

I did 7 more commits to the existing PR, but the CI is still RED! :/  
cf: [commits for this PR.](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commits?author=utkarsh2102&since=2020-06-20&until=2020-06-21)

Anyway, other than that, I reviewed a couple of PRs and found out the
culprit for breaking of CI! \o/

David, being as awesome as he is, is going to work on the fix!

Meanwhile, I set up debci and raised [MR #114](https://salsa.debian.org/ci-team/debci/-/merge_requests/114).
I took a stab at this issue. It finally shows the package details on the
retry page.

And at night, I spent ~45 minutes on studying Distributed Systems.

`:wq` for today.
