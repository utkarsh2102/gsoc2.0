Hiya,

Today was the meeting day. So earlier today, I finished the implementaion
of `get_root` and pushed the commits, here: [https://github.com/utkarsh2102/get_root](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/get_root).

`get_root` gets the root directory of your `git` repository.  
Usage is simple, just call: `GetRoot.path` :)

The only thing that one needs to take care while using `get_root` is that
it has to be a git repository. That’s a…trade-off.

However, in the meeting, we discussed that this is a bit of an
overkill. `get_root` should’ve been written as a helper function and not
as another library, which David and Antonio pointed out correctly.
But it was already too late :P  
I had already made a v 0.1.0 release.

Besides, Antonio also pointed out that it should take another arguement
as to from point from where the file is being inspected.  
Hm, unsure how to do that..

Anyway, here's the meeting snapshot as usual:

We discussed a few more things but that was mostly it :)

`:wq` for today.
