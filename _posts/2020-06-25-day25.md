Hii,

Earlier today, I did some Debian stuff. Some remaining things that I needed
to take care of:
- Uploaded `golang-github-zyedidia-tcell` to fix compatibility with micro.
- Uploaded `micro` ~ 2.0.6, with a fix for [#961853](https://bugs.debian.org/961853).
- Sponsored the upload of `libexif_0.6.21-2+deb9u4` to Stretch for Hugh.
- Sponsored the upload of `libexif_0.6.21-5+deb10u4` to Buster for Hugh.

So we had an interesting meeting today!  
The only thing I regret is that I forgot to take the meeting snapshot!! :/

Anyway, I briefly summed up the task that I did in the last week. And then
asked for help for the 2nd cop that I not being able to fix :/

But very nicely, they agreed to take a look and pair-programmed for a while.  
I kinda sucked at it (:|) but they so nicely helped and walked me through
each step, that's why they're the best! ðŸ˜­

We kinda made the first part of the 2nd cop work and there's very little
left in it to complete. That's my "homework" now! I hope I do it by next
week :x

And we also decided to split this cop into two, one with `relative` calls
and the other with `require_relative` ones!

I hope that goes well now! ðŸ™ˆ

`:wq` for today.
