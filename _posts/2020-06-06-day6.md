שלום,

I took some time off to do some work at my place -- we're in a complete lockdown
with our society sealed up because there were some COVID-19 cases coming up :/

However, I did get my [PR#9](https://github.com/robotdana/fast_ignore/pull/9)
against `fast_ignore` merged.  
Furthermore, I did set up a call with Dana for tomorrow. She's just lovely! :)

With my [FTP trainee](https://ftp-master.debian.org/) hat on, I did some reviewing
of the [NEW queue](https://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html) as well. We've been
getting complaints that the NEW queue has a huge chunk of packages pending to be
acted upon!

Later today, I raised [PR#10](https://github.com/FabioRosado/100daysof/pull/10) for
fixing some CSS for `100daysof`, a project which I am using for this very purpose,
logging my GSoC activities!

And lastly, I tried investigating [#916433](https://bugs.debian.org/916433) since
there's this FTBFS in all the version in the Debian archive, namely -- Jessie,
Stretch, Buster, Bullseye, and Sid.  
I mostly tried to take a look at this because it is blocking my `cups` upload for
`jessie-security`. Sigh.

`:wq` for today.
