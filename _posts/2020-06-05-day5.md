Ahoy,

I did. I tried to play around some Rubocop code but did get a breakthrough
yet :/  

I tried to follow up with the [development docs](https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/development.html)
but got lost in b/w their explanation.  
More specifically, I got puzzled with `AST` imlementation part.  

I've, so far, played around `ruby-parse` to check how it works. But that's that.

That later part of the day, I did some Debian stuff, with my LTS hat on.  
Mostly did the following stuff:
- Fixed CVE-2020-10663 affecting ruby-json in buster via 2.1.0+dfsg-2+deb10u1.
- Fixed CVE-2020-10663 affecting ruby-json in stretch via 2.0.1+dfsg-3+deb9u1.
- Fixed CVE-2020-10663 affecting ruby2.3 in stretch via 2.3.3-1+deb9u8.

And finally, late in the night I hosted the (fourth) Ruby team meeting \o/

I will probably take a day(s) off this weekend. And continue to work on the RuboCop
implementation from either Sunday or Monday onwards.

`:wq` for today.
