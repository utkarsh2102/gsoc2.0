Hi,

Today I spent some time on setting up `debci` and doing some hacks on it.  
Reason? None.  
Was it fun? YES!

I tried this [diff](https://paste.debian.net/1153099/) but got a `NoMethodError` :c  
Here's what I got:  
![NoMethodError](/assets/images/nomethoderror.png)

I tried to fix this but gave up after an hour or so and asked on #debci channel.

After that, I spent a couple of hours completing my previous day logs.

Apart from this, I spent the rest of my day learning Distributed Systems.  
Highly likely, I am going to keep on doing this tomorrow as well.  
It's kind of a crash course from a professor I really like!

`:wq` for today.
