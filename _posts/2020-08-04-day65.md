Hey,

Well, most importantly, I wrote the previous logs to prevent myself from
slipping from track yet again!  
Now the logs are at par and up to date.

Besides that, I did my Advanced Computer Network lab work.  
Wrote implementation of IPC using FIFO. Interesting stuff.  
Learned about [Named Pipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe)! \o/

And finally to call it a day, I worked on documentation of packaging-style-guide.  
With this, I've got a little closer to completing it mostly.

And then did some other personal stuff (learning + implementing!).  
I've got some interesting side project to hack on this coming weekend. Excited!

`:wq` for today.
