Hiya,

Today was the meeting day, so I did a lot of stuff before it :P

Here are the list of things that I did:

- First of all, as I released the gem yesterday, I wanted to make sure that
  it is being used for what it's intended to, so I raised [PR #212](https://github.com/activeadmin/arbre/pull/212)
  for `arbre`, which I maintain in Debian, and otherwise being maintained
  by David, upstream.  
  This received an interesting-yet-a-little-hurting comment by Timo (but
  it was valid, so..): [issuecomment-645576866](https://github.com/activeadmin/arbre/pull/212#issuecomment-645576866).  
  Thanks to David for backing me up so nicely! <3

- With that start, I thought it was rather better to use it myself first :P  
  So I used it in `batalert`, via [@8a9ad71](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/batalert/commit/8a9ad71104894f2422a11f8f02924c7cabaee25c)
  and released v0.4.0! \o/

- Added a couple more test of different styles to make sure that the
  library is indeed working fine, via [@ccd081c](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/commit/ccd081c3be70b5415955e848cb4f2bfc50a5ed4f).

- Raised [PR #8160](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/pull/8160) for
  adding `rubocop-packaging` as a known cop in the RuboCop documentation.  
  Bozhidar, the author of RuboCop, merged the PR and guess what he said??? ðŸ˜­

  Isn't that amazing? <3

- And finally, opened a draft [PR #4](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/pull/4),
  implementing the new RelativeRequireToLib cop + adding tests.

And lastly, we had our third weekly meeting! \o/  
And as usual, here's the snapshot:

It was a rather quick meeting and we discussed the stuff that has been
done and we discussed more on how to get the new cop done.  
David put forth some interesting suggestions (which I have no idea on how
to implement \o/). I hope to work on it next week and probably end up
crying in the next meeting!

`:wq` for today.
