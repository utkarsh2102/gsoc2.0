Hi,

First and formost, I did some quick CSE414: Advanced Computer Networks lab
work where I created a program to perform IPC using Semaphore(s).

Later, I sat down to complete previous days logs. Well, the pending list
was horribly huge!

And then later, we were told that we're supposed to give an aptitude test
for some company placements. So I gave it from 23:18 to 01:32. And I was
almost in a dead condition, very tired!

But the good thing is that the test went good, I scored 71/100.  
Not only that, I was able to solve the programming questions, too, so that's
nice! Me likey!

Well, that's all that I could sanely pull off.

`:wq` for today.
