Hey,

So today,

- I finished my entire Rails course.
- Here's the mini-project I talked about: [https://github.com/utkarsh2102/recipe_hunter](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/recipe_hunter)
- Deployed to Heroku as well, here's the working link: [https://recipe-hunter-2102.herokuapp.com/](https://recipe-hunter-2102.herokuapp.com/)
- Submitted my grading assignment and guess what? Got 100/100! \o/  
  (another way of saying that I passed all technical requirements!)

---

`:wq` for today.
