Hey,

After some exciting merges, it was time I got back to where it all started,
rubocop-packaging :P

I know the meeting day is coming and I should better have something ready
by then. Or at least have some progress to it.

So I faced some difficulties but ultimately managed to fix the AST pattern
to include `require` and `require_relative` calls and all sorts of them!  
This was nice! This was interesting! I kinda liked working today! \o/  
(yeah, I think, it's mostly because things worked and tests passed! :P)

Here's the commit: [@fdbb59f](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/pull/4/commits/fdbb59fd739f604b39b83f4b409341294b9263e9).

`:wq` for today.
