Hello,

In bullets, here's the stuff I worked on:

- Wrote and published [GSoC Phase 2 blog](https://utkarsh2102.com/posts/gsoc-phase-2/).  
  I spent a lot of time in it.

- Opened [PR #476](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails/pull/476) for
  `cucumber-rails` to drop `git` in gemspec. Got merged!

- Opened [PR #24](https://github.com/RubyCrypto/ed25519/pull/24) for
  `ed25519` to fix RuboCop warning and offenses. Got merged!  
  This was a setting point for dropping git and making it use `rubocop-packaging`.

- Joined the [cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber) organization! \o/

- Backported `golang-golang-x-text` to `buster-backports`.

- Whilst working on `rubygems` packaging, hit an obstacle and opened an
  [issue (#3831)](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/3831).

`:wq` for today.
