Hello,

So I realized I should spend lesser time writing stuff (even though it's
kinda important, but still..).

So I'd perhaps write some small pointers instead.

Today, while working on some GitLab stuff, I discovered a bug in
rubocop-packaging!  
Reported as [issue #5](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/issues/5).

`GemspecGit` cop threw failed if the file that it was inspecting was empty.  
But nicely enough, I knew the fix. So raised a [PR #6](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/pull/6).  
This should fix this. Off to review for Antonio and David.

I also raised [issue #356](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/issues/356)
against hugo-coder, the very theme I use for my blogs.


And then later, I did some research on RuboCop.

`:wq` for today.
