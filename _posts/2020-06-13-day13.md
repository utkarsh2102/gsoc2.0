Nǐ hǎo,

As discussed earlier, I decided to not work a lot of weekends and give
time to do other stuff as well!

Of course, I am kinda worried about the second cop but oh well, I think
I have something in mind. Let's see how that goes.

Today, I did some Debian LTS work, I was being paid to work on 30 hours
and had few of them remaining, so..

I did the following stuff:

- Issued [DLA 2246-1](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/06/msg00018.html), fixing [CVE-2020-13696](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13696), for [xawtv](https://tracker.debian.org/xawtv).  
  For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version 3.103-3+deb8u1.

- Issued [DLA 2248-1](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/06/msg00019.html), fixing [CVE-2020-0543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-0543), [CVE-2020-0548](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-0548), and [CVE-2020-0549](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-0549), for [intel-microcode](https://tracker.debian.org/intel-microcode).  
  For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version 3.20200609.2~deb8u1.

- Issued [DLA 2249-1](), fixing [CVE-2020-0182](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-0182) and [CVE-2020-0198](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-0198), for [libexif](https://tracker.debian.org/libexif).  
  For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version 0.6.21-2+deb8u4.

`:wq` for today.
