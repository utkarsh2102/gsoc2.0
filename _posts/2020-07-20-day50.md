Hi,

So coming back to rubocop-packaging, I did the following things:

- Raised [PR #580](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/sup/pull/580) for `sup`
  to drop `git` in gemspec.

- Raised [PR #89](https://github.com/savonrb/wasabi/pull/89) for `wasabi` to
  drop `git` in gemspec.

And later, I did a little bit of my assignment and resumed by pending Rails
course! :)

`:wq` for today.
